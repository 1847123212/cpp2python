Script helps to convert C/C++ sources to C/C++ -like Python sources.

It does few edit operations, for convert C/C++ to Python.
After it you must edit code manually, but, probably you will spend less time for it.

Utility Will make mistaces and Will not generate ready for use code, so, it won't help you, 
if you don't know either C/C++ and Python

For better result, it is recomented to format your code to ANSI style before do conversion.

NOTE: NO ANY BACKUPS CREATED. YOU MAY PERMANENTLY CORRUPT YOR SOURCES!!!

Usage:
    cpptopython.py DIR|FILE
    cpptopython.py -v|--version|-h|--help

When directory given - tries to find source files by C/C++ suffixes, when file name given - processes given file
